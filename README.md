# Simple Servant Blog

- This is a work in progress: an attempt to build
a CMS-style thing out of Servant. It's mostly for
personal interest, so it may never be finished, but it's pretty fun to work on.


## ToDo

- Write some posts.
- Make Admin/CMS actually useable for adding/editing posts/series.
- Fix date-inputter which formats and frustrates editing attempts.
- Implement media associated with posts.
- Implement media associated with people (author photos).
- Make no-js version of site and redirect if js disabled.
- Add "prev/next" links for regular posts.
- Build User-add, User-edit admin stuff.
- Add projects section of site.
- Build ReaderT stack for app access to database connection, other configuration stuff.
- Make it possible to edit series/author for posts.
- Write tests for Backend.
- Write tests for frontend.
