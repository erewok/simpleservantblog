# Simple Servant Blog

This code is the backend for [ekadanta.co](https://ekadanta.co)

It is a work in progress: an attempt to build a CMS-style thing out of Servant.

It's mostly for personal interest, so it may never be finished, but it's fun to work on.


## Tutorial

The (eventual) goal is to share and document everything done in here.


## ToDo

- Write some posts.
- Make Admin/CMS actually useable for adding/editing posts/series.
