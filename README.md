# Simple Servant Blog

- This is a work in progress: an attempt to build
a CMS-style thing out of Servant. It's mostly for
personal interest, so it may never be finished.


## ToDo

- Rewrite queries so the field ordering matches columns requested.
- Implement routing and back button.
- Fix syntax highlighting.
- Implement series/series-index.
- Continue to work on styling.
- Write tests for Backend
- Write tests for frontend
- Begin working on dockerizing application
- Nginx + Postgresql in docker-compose with shared volume for assets.
- Write auto-loader for posts in docs/author when db is empty.
- Work on deployment with CircleCI + docker + digitalocean
- Build CMS-stuff, session-less session handling
