# Simple Servant Blog

- This is a work in progress: an attempt to build
a CMS-style thing out of Servant. It's mostly for
personal interest, so it may never be finished, but it's pretty fun to work on.


## ToDo

- Build User-add, User-edit admin stuff
- Fix date-inputter which formats and frustrates editing attempts.
- Make it possible to add/edit series/author for posts.
- Add "prev/next" links for regular posts.
- Implement media associated with posts.
- Write tests for Backend
- Write tests for frontend
- Nginx + Postgresql in docker-compose with shared volume for assets.
- TLS Cert Auto-Renewal
